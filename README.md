Here's the complete code for a simple Java program that allows users to interact with an employee leave management system without using a database. The program uses in-memory data structures to store employee information and leave requests. It also allows user input for requesting leave and checking leave balances.
Users can select options to request leave, check leave balances, or exit the program.
When requesting leave, users input the start date, end date, and leave type.
The program then checks the available leave balance and saves the leave request if the balance is sufficient.
When checking leave balances, the program displays the annual and sick leave balances for the employee.
